Abstract: Physarum polycephalum is a microorganism that has been extensively studied for its intelligent behaviours. Recently, the mycelium of the mushroom \textit{Pleurotus ostreatus} has been found to exhibit similar properties as those of \textit{physarum polycephalum}, but the extent of their similarities are not clear. Our research proposes an agent-based model of mycelium to model its behaviour, which is corroborate through growing live mycelium tissue samples. The similarity of the simulated mycelium to the live mycelium, and ultimately the live mycelium to \textit{physarum}, is established by computing and comparing each respective networks' fractal dimensions. Finally, the mycelium is simulated over a map of Karachi to propose a transport network optimization for the city of Karachi.
