    abstract = {Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks— in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},

    abstract = { We propose that fungi Basidiomycetes can be used as computing devices: information is represented by spikes of electrical activity, a computation is implemented in a mycelium network and an interface is realized via fruit bodies. In a series of scoping experiments, we demonstrate that electrical activity recorded on fruits might act as a reliable indicator of the fungi’s response to thermal and chemical stimulation. A stimulation of a fruit is reflected in changes of electrical activity of other fruits of a cluster, i.e. there is distant information transfer between fungal fruit bodies. In an automaton model of a fungal computer, we show how to implement computation with fungi and demonstrate that a structure of logical functions computed is determined by mycelium geometry. }

abstract = {Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that is apparently able to solve shortest path problems. A mathematical model has been proposed by Tero et al. (Journal of Theoretical Biology, 244, 2007, pp. 553–564) to describe the feedback mechanism used by the slime mold to adapt its tubular channels while foraging two food sources s0 and s1. We prove that, under this model, the mass of the mold will eventually converge to the shortest s0–s1 path of the network that the mold lies on, independently of the structure of the network or of the initial mass distribution. This matches the experimental observations by Tero et al. and can be seen as an example of a “natural algorithm”, that is, an algorithm developed by evolution over millions of years.}

    abstract="What searching strategies the slime mould adopts when exploring three-dimensional terrains? How optimal are transport routes approximated by the slime mould's protoplasmic tubes? Do the routes built by slime mould on 3D terrains match real-world transport routes? We conducted laboratory experiments with Nylon terrains of USA and Germany. We used the slime mould to approximate route 20, the longest road in USA, and autobahn 7, the longest national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mould builds longer transport routes on 3D terrains, comparing to flat substrates yet sufficiently approximates man-made transport routes studied. We demonstrated how nutrients placed in destination sites affect performance of slime mould and shown how the slime mould navigates around elevations. In cellular automaton models of the slime mould we shown that the variability of the protoplasmic routes might depends on physiological states of the slime mould.",
