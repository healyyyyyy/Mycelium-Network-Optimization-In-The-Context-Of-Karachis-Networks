    abstract = { We propose that fungi Basidiomycetes can be used as computing devices: information is represented by spikes of electrical activity, a computation is implemented in a mycelium network and an interface is realized via fruit bodies. In a series of scoping experiments, we demonstrate that electrical activity recorded on fruits might act as a reliable indicator of the fungi’s response to thermal and chemical stimulation. A stimulation of a fruit is reflected in changes of electrical activity of other fruits of a cluster, i.e. there is distant information transfer between fungal fruit bodies. In an automaton model of a fungal computer, we show how to implement computation with fungi and demonstrate that a structure of logical functions computed is determined by mycelium geometry. }

 abstract = {Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks— in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},

abstract="The solutions to Traveling Salesman Problem can be widely applied in many real-world problems. Ant colony optimization algorithms can provide an approximate solution to a Traveling Salesman Problem. However, most ant colony optimization algorithms suffer premature convergence and low convergence rate. With these observations in mind, a novel ant colony system is proposed, which employs the unique feature of critical tubes reserved in the Physaurm-inspired mathematical model. A series of experiments are conducted, which are consolidated by two real-world Traveling Salesman Problems. The experimental results show that the proposed new ant colony system outperforms classical ant colony system, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm in efficiency and robustness.",

abstract="What searching strategies the slime mould adopts when exploring three-dimensional terrains? How optimal are transport routes approximated by the slime mould's protoplasmic tubes? Do the routes built by slime mould on 3D terrains match real-world transport routes? We conducted laboratory experiments with Nylon terrains of USA and Germany. We used the slime mould to approximate route 20, the longest road in USA, and autobahn 7, the longest national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mould builds longer transport routes on 3D terrains, comparing to flat substrates yet sufficiently approximates man-made transport routes studied. We demonstrated how nutrients placed in destination sites affect performance of slime mould and shown how the slime mould navigates around elevations. In cellular automaton models of the slime mould we shown that the variability of the protoplasmic routes might depends on physiological states of the slime mould.",
